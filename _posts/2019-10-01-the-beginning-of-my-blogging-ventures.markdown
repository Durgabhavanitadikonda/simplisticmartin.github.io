# Beginning of my Blogging Ventures

It took a long time to set up a Blogging system. Especially without a database or backend technology. I wanted to incorporate it in a single place where I can focus my attention to. I found Jekyll and this theme which reminds me of medium which is a popular blogging platform which I find myself sometimes looking towards to for advice. The reason I didn't use medium is because this blog is just about me. If I wanted to take pictures and share it here, I can without guilt and unapologetically so. I can't just make a random blog post about a cute puppy on medium so for those reasons alone, it strayed me off that platform. This blogging system is to document what I have learned and what I know so far.



# Plans

## Course Reviews

I have many courses from various websites such as udacity, codeacademy, coursera, edx, udemy and the lists go on and on. I really would prefer to acquire those knowledge but its hard to keep focused but I desire to do so so I will finish courses to make sure I can properly review them. I want to take concepts in these courses and break them down well.
Its boring and tedious. Theres no fast way to really do this. I just find that if you find different ways to break down, material preferably with hands on work, the process becomes much more buttery smooth.

## Job Preparation

This process will be boring but to have success it has to move forward. I have to hit ball parks, create applications and improving my interview skills. I want to document this process. I have a camera which I can record this or I can simply Blog about it. Which ever way I slice it, I have to make it happen.


## Books I have read

Self help books are my favorite genre. So generally speaking, I like non-fiction. I never got into the habit of reading other books for that reason, I haven't watched movies as well. I watched a movie every couple of months if I get called out to. There is too much content being created and as we speak probably dozens of movies aunorderd listsre made in the process. I mean hollywood blockbusters not indie films(Can you imagine?).

## Technology and Explained Concepts

Theoretical and non-applicable ways to learn technology isn't ever so fun to me but If I ever get them down, I like to break them down. To levels in which I hope normal everyday humans can relate to.

## Self-made tutorials
How do I do X to achieve Y? I have always wanted to share my knowledge like I said. It takes being immersed and breaking down things several times to get through.

## Hobbies and other things
I like to have fun.(who doesn't?). If I make progress in a day of dancing or boxing or something of that nature I like to share it. If I watch a sport session and it gets my heart racing, I'd like that too to be shared. 

## Life issues and solutions
Of course everyday, everybody on planet earth and namek has issues. me included and your favorite president of course. We all want solutions to our personal problems with the additional addition of results. I'd like to share things that made me right from whenI was wrong.

## Quotes of the day
I really liked this quote and I want to remind myself of it:
>_All we really own in life are moments in time_
